To compile vm's, you will need to add the compiler tools (included in the ./bin/ directory) to your systems path.

To add the path:
-----------------------
Windows Vista and above
-----------------------
Right-click on My Computer and select Properties then > Advanced system settings > Advanced > Environmental Variables

-----------------------
Windows XP
-----------------------
Right-click 'My Computer' and select Properties then Advanced > Environmental Variables


Under 'system variables' locate the 'path' setting and add the full path to your 'bin' folder containing the compiler tools.
Example:   ;C:\Programming\RPM-0.75.x\bin


Run the batch file for the project you wish to compile.  If the mod compiles successful then the path was added correctly.

The *.vm files are set to output to the './SOF2/RPM/vm/' folder relative to the 'Source Code - RPM 0.75.x' directory.  
You can change the output directory in the *.bat file of the project you are compiling.
